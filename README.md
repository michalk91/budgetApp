## Description
This is a budget management app. The application allows you to create users and perform subsequent operations such as changing your password, email address, etc. For presentation purposes, there is a user called "Guest" which has certain restrictions related to deleting the account, changing the email address, etc. Additionally, the user "Guest" cannot add or remove income and expense categories. You can set a budget and then add expenses and income to update the budget. You can also edit and delete expenses. All expenses and revenues have their own category, creation date, and modification date. The application also allows you to add categories of expenses and income (The "Guest" account cannot do this). After adding expenses, the application will display charts showing the percentage of expenses by category.
