## Description
This is a budget management application. Budgets can be managed independently or in collaboration with other users by granting them the necessary permission.

## Features:
- Users are able to register an account and log in to the application.
- Users have the capability to update their profile information, including changing their password (except for users logged in anonymously).
- Possibility to log in as anonymous for demonstration purposes. This account is automatically deleted after logging out.
- Users can create budgets which can be managed jointly with other users.
- The app provides the option to select the currency for the budget.
- Users can add or delete expense and income categories.
- Charts displaying the percentage of expenses by category are visible in the application.
- A user who invites another user to their budget can assign them permissions to manage categories and manage all transactions. By default, the invited user can only delete their own expenses. The user who is the owner of the budget can delete all expenses.

## The application uses the flip technique for animations.
